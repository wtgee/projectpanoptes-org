The first Baseline PANOPTES unit, PAN001, was upgraded in March 2017 to the

condition shown below. This page will describe what its various components do,

and how they work together; however, it does not go into how the captured images

are processed to extract scientifically useful data; for more on that, read

\[Olivier Guyonâ€™s pages\](https://www.naoj.org/staff/guyon/09allskysurvey.web/content.html)

describing the early history of Project PANOPTES, and the paper by \[Gee, Guyon,

Walawender, Jovanovic and Boucher\](http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/handle/10150/622806).
