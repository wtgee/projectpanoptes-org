- description: Due to the simplicity and low cost a PANOPTES "unit" can be built quickly
    and easily by students or amateur scientists. PANOPTES is designed from the ground
    up to be a citizen science project which will involve the public in all aspects
    of the science, from data acquisition to reduction. An entire exoplanet finding
    telescope can be built for about $5000 USD.
