# Software

All PANOPTES authored software is open source and available on [github](https://github.com/panoptes/).

The [PANOPTES Observatory Control System (POCS)](https://github.com/panoptes/POCS) has been written from the ground up using python.

The photometry algorithm which extracts accurate photometry from DSLR images which have a bayer filter array to encode color information was originally developed by Olivier Guyon and is described on his [web page](http://www.naoj.org/staff/guyon/09allskysurvey.web/56photometry.web/content.html). The algorithm has been implemented in C, but will be wrapped in a data pipeline which will be written in python.
